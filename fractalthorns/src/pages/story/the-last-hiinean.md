The cold, cloudy air surrounds me, rushing across my face and my clothes, stealing my exhaled breaths. I overlook a massive savannah, fractured into continents of clay by decades of dryness, spattered with the courageous sproutings of hardy patches of bush and grass. The sun peeks sheepishly from behind the deep blueness of the overcast sky, casting gentle rays that illuminate the falling rain. 

My feet dangling from the cliffside, I stick out a purple-scaled hand, and let a single raindrop fall onto its ragged and rough fingertip. The pearl of water rests there for a moment, then swiftly drips from my finger and is gone. Its short but beautiful journey through the sky ends with it becoming one with the earth again.

My name is Chasnah. For all of my life, I have been a traveler - for most of it, part of the Frontierers, a guild of cartographers united under the endless journey to map out the vast, unexplored world. Some sought glory, some only the simple joy of the outdoors, some merely to taste of the vast wealth of the Frontierer's coffers. But none of these things mattered to me - I was once called to the great unknown for the answers it might have held.

My dreams are still haunted by that canyon. The chilling emptiness. The storyless scraps of a civilization stamped from existence. The echoing silence. It was all too much for me to bear... the weight of that place sits like a stone in my stomach, even now.

Wysak Canyon used to be the home of the Hiineans. We were a rare and unique species, sisters to the much more abundant Llokin, renowned - at least by those who knew of our existence - for our bio-luminescent horns and claws. Accustomed to the darkness, the people lived very secluded lives in the canyon, burrowed so deeply in the land that they were indistinguishable from it. Very few anthropologists even knew they existed, even fewer studied them in any detail, and none at all so much as wrote down what they found. The Hiineans were just one of a thousand of such isolated species, they say - maybe interesting to some, but boring to the scholars.

So nobody noticed when they vanished.

I visited the canyon every day for years, trying to dig through the scraps that the anthropologists wouldn't. A few shreds of indecipherable writing here, a petrified log of wood there, a lonely sandstone brick someplace else. Almost nothing remained, only a handful of pieces to a continental jigsaw puzzle.

My memories are inhabited by only the foggiest specters of my parents, my people, this world I never knew. As a child of only a few days, I was somehow spared from this rapture holding nothing but my own eggshell and a strange luminescent blade that bore the forgotten marks of my people. Orphaned in a world that was powerless to return me where I belonged, I fell into the adoptive care of a wealthy couple from an estate nearby the canyon itself. They dearly loved me, and I did them, but still I felt alone as my peers gawked at my exotic otherness, made idle wishes about the fate of my people, inexorably seeing me as the anomaly I was. I wanted so badly to go where they had. To see them again, to feel the embrace of my real parents, play with my real brothers and sisters, to worship nature as they did, eat their foods and speak their tongue and write their words, to understand what it _meant_ to be Hiinean.

As I became an adult, the staleness of the land and the people around me became unbearable. The ghosts of the Hiineans had left that canyon. There was nothing else for me to see here. So I put in my application to become a Frontierer. If the answers were out there, I needed to find them myself. If the Hiineans were out there somewhere, waiting for their son to find his way home and become whole again... I needed to get there myself.

Then there was this sword... the remarkable thing had survived the cataclysm with me. Whether it was intended for me, or simply fell into my hands from those of another, its strange presence gnawed at my every free thought. Emblazoned with a message I could not read, singing of some microcosm of Hiinean culture I did not know, I did the only thing I thought I could to reconnect with its message; I looked for a teacher who might help me speak in the language of combat. While he seemed to consider me his brightest pupil, the weapon always felt awkward and clumsy in my hands. Not hearing the voices of my people in its swings, I realized I may not understand until I was truly Hiinean again - and so after a few years, when my persistence with the Frontierers finally wore them down and they agreed to give me a home on the trail, I left for the undiscovered world to chase them.

For years, I sank myself in this purpose. Every night I promised to the stars that my heart should never be still until I had found my way back home. Braving frozen lakes held by frost-capped mountains, jungles thick with verdant life and thicker with buzzing insects, and backbones of red rocks in scorching deserts, the Frontierers provided me with near-limitless supplies in exchange for my cartography. Of course that exchange was never my interest... the grueling work and restless nights I roughed through, I did it not to sketch out a more few inches of the vastly empty Auzoan map on someone's wall, but for any chance, even a small as a single purple scale in the sand, to find my way home. I would hunt forever if I needed to.

Then it happened.

Looming pines over my head, their needles and bark draped in ribbons of amber as the sun just began to set behind nameless cliffs of snow white rock, something caught my eye in the soil. A sigil - the shadow of a meaning I did not know, but a form that I understood. A Hiinean letter. One like those on my silent sword, one like those in the dust of the dead canyon.

Trembling, I pushed aside the layer of autumn colors to reveal the artifact in whole. It was a small thing - a piece of rock, carved with a handful of runes. I used my luminescent claws to poke out the dirt and decaying needles that entered its crevices. A shape formed - an image, a carved recreation of a place, a horizon, a sun, a pattern of rocks. I did not know what it said, or what it meant, but I felt something indescribable settle over all of the fibers of my body as my shaking hands held this recovered message. Night fell, the painted sky turning to streaks of orange, then red, then purple, the stars twinkling powerfully in the cold air watching as I curled my knees to my chin, held the stone to my inconsolable heart and cried tears I had not shed for years.

The next morning, unrested but totally unexhausted, I called back to the office, gathering the contacts for every Frontierer I had any right to access. With a clear trace of the stone's image penned out in my notebook, I taped it in front of my transponder's camera as I furiously punched in name after name, asking anyone caught in my path the same question: Have we seen place this before? As expected, my efforts were unanimously met with confusion and uncertainty. But these were Frontierers... if someone had come across this place before, it would have been recorded, documented, mapped, and photographed, like every other inch of the unknown planet. Someone would remember.

And someone did. It was hours of continuous calling and asking and hearing stilted, dead-end replies, many more than I could count on my fingers, but finally, one of the bored voices on the other end confirmed he had been there once. I asked for photographs - he provided. I asked what the fastest way to get there was, and recognizing me as the wistful Hiinean, he said jokingly that he would let headquarters know to start preparing a severance package for me. I hung up.

They called it the Valley of Midnight. A mostly unremarkable grassland hugged by a blanket of cerulean flowers, it gets its name from the eponymous valley within that seems to be perpetually filled with a thick, daylight-obscuring fog. I arrived very early in the morning, after several days of travel - I was not counting the nights. It could have taken years, and I would not have cared. 

A warm mist hung over the fields of blue, the blades of grass and azure petals glittering with jewels of dew as the sky above blazed with hazy oranges and yellows. The occasional pillar of moss-eaten rocks jutted from the rolling hills, casting long, cool shadows across the flowers. Letting my skin drink the warmth and humidity, I simply paced through the field for what felt like hours, tracing a great circle around the fog-filled valley. Much more like a smoke than a mist, the ghastly clouds below my feet seemed to churn and seethe across the rolling grass, the stripes of sapphire flora spiraling with the ground into its darkness.

Eventually, as I wandered through the grass, I came across the exact site of the carving. The stones looked slightly different now, but their shape was unmistakable. Holding the sketch up to the sky, and knowing my I stood directly in the footprints of my ancestors, a wave of gut-wrenching hope crashed over me and dropped me to my knees. Sitting back against the grass, I threw off the weight of my explorer's backpack and bent forward to wrestle off my boots, so that my feet could feel the cool wetness of the grass and the soil. The glowing claws on my toes lit up the roots of the grass - I wondered if soon I would finally be worthy of them, feel comfortable wearing their still-ominous glow. I sat there watching the cloudy sky for an eternity.

My whole life, I had been traveling - trying to find who I was, the place I really belonged, the meaning I really had. But this is where my journey really began.

## Act 2 - The Valley of Midnight

<div class="act-img-header">
    <div class="act-img-frame frame-2"></div>
    <div class="act-img act-2"></div>
</div>

As morning turned to noon, I had gotten back on my feet, and in a rocky crevice not far from the valley itself, I rummaged through the countless pockets and pouches on backpack to set up my shelter, a drab, weathered canvas tent that I had become far too used to from my years of vagrancy. 

But as I worked, unfolding the olive-blue fabric and placing metal spokes in the ground, I noticed an odd phenomenon in the grass nearby - it seemed to be parted and pushed down in patches, as if it had been walked on over days and months and turned into a path. This was the first hint of life I had seen since arriving, so I leapt to investigate immediately, dropping the half-erected tent I had in my hands against the soil. Indeed, the regions of impounded grass formed a trail that meandered around the hills - a trail that was dotted now and again with little golden feathers resting against the ground, peeking out timidly from the shadows between the blades of grass.

As I put one foot after another down the trail, the hills parted enough to make out something rising against the vast ocean of cloudless sky - a little cabin, formed out of some kind of adobe or hardened clay, painted in a warm and rosy mixture of light purple and red. The sight of it stole my breath. I swallowed harshly, my heart swelling with anticipation and fear, my mind jumping between a dozen possible explanations for it. 

Resolving now to leave my home slumped in the soil for the moment, I approached the cabin with only my sword sheathed across my back, my eyes completely fixed on its silhouette. Details came into view, letting me see the place was definitely lived and worn. The surface paint was chipped and cracked, particularly around the edges, revealing the sunbleached color of the material behind - the roof, made of simple slate shingles, had a spattering of dents and chips - an old, splintered wooden ladder laid lazily near one of the windows, which was obscured from the inside by a set of washed-out, light curtains. Still, the surroundings were mostly tidy, the glass was clean, the paint had had some effort to be reapplied; it was rough, but loved, and I could tell even without being inside it was likely nicer than any place I slept since I started Frontiering. And off to the left side, there was a tiny personal aircraft parked slightly askew in a patch of open dirt. Painted in faded white and an earthy, muted red, its propeller and wings were rusted and worn, but its wheels were in perfect condition, as if they'd been recently replaced. 

Approaching the cabin from its south-east corner, I walked to face the front, where a meager wooden patio and a door came into view. Seeing the entrance, I began to notice that everything about the place felt just a little too small - the door itself was stunted compared to my height, just barely too small to contain myself standing upright, and the steps of the patio were not an inch too large for my feet, and creaked under just the weight of my tail resting loosely against them.

A trailing list of questions for this resident of nowhere was tangled up in my head. And as unlikely as it seemed, from the architecture to the decor to the uncomfortable sizing, my heart of course stirred with the possibility that this _was_ the Hiinean who sent me here. The one who made that stone carving in the woods, who had been looking for me this entire time, who had been trying to carry on our legacy in solitude, just like me. The overhead sun warmed and soothed my nerves, and I filled my chest with a deep breath of the crisp air.

Bending down slightly, I knocked as gently as I reasonably could on the door, echoing a quick string of wooden beats through the still sky. 

There was a very brief pause, then the clacking of the lock in the door, and the hurried creak of its weight quickly opening to a mere crack, just large enough for an eyeball to peer back at me. It seemed to be drawn instantly to a point just above my eyes, assumedly right onto my glowing horns, after which it contracted very slightly in shock, then darted fiercely to lock in eye contact with me.

This was not a Hiinean. The muscles in my stomach tensed slightly, as the realization hit me like cold water had been thrown in my face. The eye instead belonged to some kind of avian - it was beady and dark, wrapped in yellow-orange feathers. I exhaled slightly as a thread of anxiety left my body, but the stranger's stare was still certainly unsettling.

"H-Hi." I pushed out the word very awkwardly. Sensing fear and uncertainty in their gaze, I tried to smile as naturally as I could, and thought briefly about what the most unthreatening version of my story would be.

"My name is Chasnah - I'm a Frontierer and -"

I leapt out of my skin as the stranger's eye widened in disgust and slammed the door shut, my words being sliced into a hushed expletive. I stood there for few moments, stepping back from the door with my hands clasped anxiously together, then took a moment to exhale the stress and stand up straight again. The silence of the world returned to my ears - not even a rustling from inside the house was audible.

Much as I am indifferent to them, Frontierers are usually well respected, especially to those on the fringes of society - which is why I decided to lead with that fact, and why their reaction surprised me. 

A conflict erupted in my head. My surprise melted into concern that I had lost their cooperation and buried leads towards the answers I sought. A quick bout of anger stirred within me that every road I traveled seemed to be so marred with obstacles. But, their message was clear - I was not welcome, so to avoid any violence, I began to turn and carefully descend the steps again, the aged wood squeaking as I hobbled down them. 

But shortly after I had made it to the grass again, I heard an indistinct voice call to me.

"Are you a Hiinean?"

The stranger had opened the door again, this time enough that I could see her entire face. The distance between us made it fuzzy, but I could see the crowning plumage that rose from the back of her head. It was made of bright yellow feathers tipped with an emerald green, and from the sides rose two particularly large crests that rose into the air at a diagonal. Her beak was tinted a lime green and was thick and blocky. She was a quite a bit shorter and smaller than me, able to fit comfortably in the door frame while standing mostly upright.

I tentatively replied. "I think so?" The question caught me completely off guard - I did not expect to hear that name. I began to creep back up the steps.

"You've heard that name? I must admit, I'm quite surprised." I asked. But she just continued to hold an unamused expression.

"What are you doing here?" She questioned viciously.

"Well - I'm looking for Hiineans, or anything they left behind." I was happy to cut small talk and introductions and simply echo her directness. "I've been travelling for a long time to figure out what happened to them. I found a carving of this place, somewhere way on the other side of the Auzoan Frontier." Rifling through the many occupied pockets and loops of my mountaineering pants, I produced the sketch I had copied into my notebook, and rose it to her eyes. "Does this... mean anything to you?" I asked.

Looking at the inked page, her expression seemed to change slightly, a minuscule tinge of sadness and regret appearing on her brow. She moved her eyes to mine again.

"No," she blithely replied.

"Okay - is there anything, anything at all, you can tell me? Maybe something you've found here, maybe something you've heard...?"

"No." She stated flatly again. The word was a dagger in my heart. My expression did not hide it.

"How do you even know who we are?" I asked, my voice faltering from the pain in my heart. "This is very far from Wysak. Even closeby, hardly anyone cares."

"Do you have anywhere to stay?" She asked forcefully. Her tone was strained, as if her words were struggling to shove themselves out of her mouth. And in my mind, I was reeling from her deflection of my question. I squeezed my fists together and breathed deeply to control my temper. 

I wanted to respond that it did not matter, as like any Frontierer, I've lived out of my backpack and under the stars for years. But it was extremely rare for someone to offer their home to one of us, and given her previous behavior, I thought it would be best to simply appease her tacit nature and answer her questions directly.

"No."

She closely and uncomfortably held my gaze. But after a pause of a few seconds, her eyes falling away from mine, she finally continued. "If you'd like a real roof over your head for a day, you can stay here."

To tell the truth, I was elated at her response. This was such a rare luxury, and her tone revealed that she knew that. Though I was confused why she would extend such a gesture of hospitality when the haze of disgust and contempt around her was thick enough to breathe in, I still selfishly could not help but agree, not only for the chance to live and sleep away from the elements, but to ensure I had as many opportunities as possible to talk to her. So, I nodded my head in acceptance, and she sheepishly pulled the door back to open the cabin to me.

I had to duck to fit my horns within the doorway. As I became surrounded by the clay walls, the breeze off my skin was replaced with a warm blanket of still air, and the smells of dew on grass were replaced by that of stale dust and wood. It was not much bigger inside than it looked on the outside - it could be described anywhere from cozy to hoplessly cramped, even for someone of the intended size.

An orange tone was mixed through all the colors of the house. The walls were now a cheerful amber, as opposed to the soft lavender they appeared on the outside. The furniture, consisting of a couch upholstered with thick apricot fabric at an angle in the middle of the room, a dark wooden coffee table that was strewn with open books, and several teeming bookshelves on the opposite wall, were all covered in a thin but noticeable layer of dust, and all seemed to have fallen into slight disrepair, bandages of duct tape and grafts of other grains of wood occasionally being visible. The ceiling was an open lattice of beams and supports, and light fell into the room harshly, suspending particles of dust in bright white sunbeams. In just about every corner of the room was a small pile of shed feathers swept against the wooden baseboard, while the rest of the floor was occupied by a large, uncertain, off-center rug that may have once been blue and green but has since turned a desaturated amber.

The stranger shut the door behind me, clicking the lock back into place - then took a few steps away from me, and avoiding eye contact, moved towards the other side of the room where the bookshelves rested, stopping in front of another door.

"That couch is yours. You can stay for one night." She said flatly without meeting my gaze. "I hope you find whatever you're looking for." Then she opened the door, seemingly leading to another, even smaller and more cluttered room, before slipping away and shutting it tightly, without giving me a chance to thank her, or even ask for her name.

Her strangely evasive behavior concerned me, but it could not erode the purpose within my heart. Once again I finally had peace to think, and of course, idleness drifted my mind straight back to why I was here. 

I looked at the books that were piled atop the coffee table - alongside a few empty cups of tea, there was literature on a myriad of unrelated subjects, everything from medicine to horticulture to mathematics. I turned to the bookshelves and skimmed their spines - my eyes caught on a few books on anthropology, only one or two of which I had not read before. Skimming through those, struggling to hold an entire encyclopedia's worth of weight and awkwardness in my left hand while paging with my right, I saw read nothing about Hiineans, not even in footnotes.

As the house itself was silent to my questions, I wanted nothing else but to have a conversation with this odd hermit; what she knows, why she is here, what other directions she could lead me in. Perhaps, though, now was simply not the time. A bigger question played upon my subconscious, something that only now started to reenter my mind - the valley itself.

As noon turned to evening, I went back outside to gather my belongings, returning the abandoned tent to my backpack and bringing the rest of my folded up, stuffed together life with me into the house. From my pack, I produced my battery-powered lantern, flicked it on and off a few times with the switch on its handle, and looped it onto my belt. I unsheathed my sword and held it - the blade hummed, its blazing fuschia burning my eyes, and despite holding it with form and discipline, it felt as unnatural as ever.

Leaving the rest of my pack behind for now, I left the cabin again and descended for the valley itself.

The fog within continued to swirl and billow like clouds. It started thin and mist-like at the top, but quickly became thicker and darker, swallowing the grass and the flowers whole, as it entered the depths of the valley. Unlooping the lantern and holding it tightly, I flicked it on and began to step carefully down the grassy slope. It was steep enough to press my toes uncomfortably against my boots, but not so much I had to hobble down sideways.

Before long, I had lowered myself into the mists. The sun began to fade in the sky, obscured by the particles in the air. It smelled clean and fresh, like the mist off of an open freshwater lake in the midday, or the scent of passing rain warmed by the sun through an overcast sky. My breath disturbed it, causing it to dance in spirals and curves. I felt like I was touching clouds. 

As it became thicker, I saw less and less of the plains around me, and felt less and less of the sun. The cold and the silence was unnerving, if only slightly so - I had never seen something quite like this before. It reminded me of a bad dream. But having been walking in the hot sun in a sweater for hours beforehand, I did welcome it.

Soon enough, it felt like night had fallen. The sun was indiscernible - there was now a thick roof of clouds over my head, painted in deep, dark grays and fathomless blues, only barely illuminated by the tiny particles of light that were lucky enough to still bounce within them. The amber glow of my lantern, casting swaying rectangles of light across the grass, became the only reason I could even see the ground anymore. There seemed to have been a clearing in the fog, leaving the bulk of the mist above me and the visibility along the ground relatively unobstructed, save for the lack of light. With this clearing, the slope gradually smoothed out, and left my feet on solid ground again - still hugged by the wet soil, flowers, and grass. I wondered how the flora was still thriving down here, with no sunlight at all to sustain it.

But this was all the valley had for me to see. I wandered to find ruins, structures, footsteps, trails, anything at all - but the emptiness was just like the rest of the hills around me, miles and miles of uninterrupted, rolling soil. 

Eventually I came to rest, sitting upright against the grass with my tail limp in my lap, watching the tumultuous display of the clouds churning above me, restless waves and ripples in the sky, drinking in the cool silence. It was remarkably peaceful. I felt as though I was miles and miles underwater, a rock lost on the ocean floor. And while I could not help but smile in the serenity, my heart continued to ache. My mind kept playing tricks on me - seeing silhouettes of something purple glowing in the darkness. Even though I knew it was just my imagination, I turned off my lantern anyway, in the hopes that they would stand out better in the pure darkness. Holding the still-warm caged glass to my chest, with the only light remaining the soft luminescence of my horns and claws, I simply laid back and watched the stars.

Wait... stars?

I bolted upright. Yes, there was something _glittering_ floating through the air, something I had never noticed while the lantern was on. Like little blue fireflies, specs of cerulean dust, they sat suspended between the ground and the clouds, swaying gently up and down in wide arcs. I reached my finger out to touch one, but lost it in the glow of my own claws.

Each of them began to slow down. I saw now that these specks were not just swaying randomly, but lining up. Slowly, one by one, as I gazed on with disbelief and wonder, they filled out into a lattice pattern, taking the corners of an invisible grid of cubes.  I tried to approach one, which had now become fixed and stiff in the air, but as I came closer to them, they simply vanished.

The last few dots of blue light drifted into place, and their once chaotic miasma had now solidified into a crystal of air, a molecular lattice held together by unknowable forces. My mouth hung slightly ajar at the display, and my thoughts had no words to make sense of what I was seeing.

Then a rumbling noise permeated the earth. My heart began to pound. A burning droplet of fear diffused into my blood. I was completely on my feet now, my head darting all around me to identity the source and meaning of the noise. But there was nothing, and it only continued to grow louder, until -

The sky screamed, and cracked open. Above me, the dots began to violently dissipate, seeming to tear away the very fabric of reality and reveal another. With the terrible sound of rending glass, the clouds were gradually replaced with a growing vision of an orange sky, as if I were in an observatory opening to the morning sun - and as the edges of the new reality dropped downwards, it replaced the dark horizon with a cloud-topped mountain range, the grass and flowers with sparkling white sand, and the very earth around my feet with wet mud. The world's screaming harmonized into a crescendo, echoing with a single beautiful chord that crackled in the air and dissolved like evaporating ice, until silence returned.

My vision shook as my head bobbed up and down, my lungs hyperventilating and my heart beating faster and harder than I have ever felt it. My veins were filled with the numbness of adrenaline, but all I could do was slowly look around me, my eyes widened in amazement, my mouth completely open in shock.

I had been transported. My surroundings resembled something of a cross between a desert and an evergreen forest - the sky was drenched in stunning copper shades of orange and green as the sun rose, illuminating the gray bark and leaves of odd, pine-like trees with many-branched trunks, sprouting regularly from the brilliant white sand. I stood right besides an oasis of turquoise water, where a garden of otherworldly plants sprouted from the mud, strange, unexplainable growths that looked like petrified eyestalks and living auroras. My boots began to sink in the mud, so I tried to waddle out of it and stand on the sturdier sand, though my shaking legs made that a challenge.

As I regained my bearings, I was overwhelmed with a wave of emotions - fear and confusion, yes, but soaring above all else came hope and excitement. The indescribable magic I had just experienced could only be a sign I was on the right path.

Where was I? Judging by the position of the sun, and assuming I had not also traveled through time, I had been transported _far, far_ away from anywhere anyone on Auzoa knew. It would have been evening for everyone on the tiny stretch of the planet we knew - but here it was morning. That is, of course, if I was even still on the same planet.

A huge insect, maybe the size of my fist, buzzed ferociously past me. I spun around to watch it - it was like a seafly, with a long slender body, stubby legs, and huge beady eyes, but proudly displaying a cluster of iridescent orbs atop its head, and beating its wings with a massive force that drilled into my ears, appropriate for the size of its body. It dropped to the ground, then promptly buried itself into the sand with an aggressive wiggling motion, just enough to hide its body but leave the orbs exposed.

Was this my ancestral homeland? It is true that our bio-luminescence is very odd... as odd as many of the things here. And obviously, though nothing here felt familiar - why would it? I never even saw the towns and houses of my people. I never saw the plants they grew or the things they ate. The only Hiinean I ever knew was the fraud in the mirror.

I looked for Hiinean letters. I may not recognize anything else, but I could recognize the writing. Yet, clearly, I was very deep in the untamed reaches of wilderness. There was no sign of civilization in any direction, just miles and miles of needles and desert surrounded by mountain ranges. As the adrenaline began to filter out of my blood, I started to realize I was having difficulty breathing, and walking was tiring, even without the dozens of pounds of equipment and supplies draped over my back.

Despite everything, I resolved to press on. I felt the fringes of my destiny play at my fingertips. If I had to hunt the answers forever, I would. All I needed was another tiny sign - a fragment in the sand, a sigil on a rock, to guide my path home. Just anything at all, no matter how insignificant.

Although the sun was rising, it was still very hard to see. My lantern still laid dormant in my hand - so, with a squeeze of my shaking hand, I turned it on, and -

My eyes completely gave out. I saw nothing.

Raising my head sharply, I nearly passed out. The entire world was spinning. My balance thrown, I fell onto my face, digging into grassy dirt with my nose before tumbling onto my side, my tail following through shortly after. Hyperventilating, I tried to swallow down the sickness in my stomach. It felt like oxygen had returned to the air and I could breathe again, so I remained there on the ground, feeling the wetness of the flowers on my skin, filling my lungs with cool air and forcing out the stale miasma of the desert.

As my vision readjusted, I saw the tumultuous clouds of the valley out of one eye, and the familiar carpet of grasses and flowers below with other. The valley had dragged me back. I rose suddenly to my feet, choking down the wave of nausea that resulted, brushing the petals from my pants and sweater. 

Deep, confused frustration soaked through every inch of my body. An impulse shot down my arm, reaching frantically for the lantern to turn it back off - but bathing the land in darkness again did not return me. Nor did it send the dancing stars back to the air, even as I waited for agonizing minutes, taking in deep, frantic breaths under which I pleaded for them to come back and send me there again. I had gotten so close... and it was stolen from me.

There was a flash of boiling anger, a disturbed rage that the world would deny me the chance to reclaim even the most minute scraps of my missing life. I felt hot as the rage and misery mounted, and with shaking haste I pulled my sword from my back and threw it into the dark, its crystalline blade clanging against the ground until it came to rest. I wailed into the valley's night - first with fury, then as my emotions were exhausted, with tears. Nature heard my screams with indifference, the grass simply continuing to sway, the clouds simply continuing to swirl. 

My head and chest beginning to forcefully complain of exhaustion, it seemed no choice was left but to accept I would see no more from this journey. I bent to reclaim my dejected sword, and with my body half unwilling, retraced my steps out of the valley. Surfacing from the mists, feeling the strain of the uphill climb, the sun was now beginning to set. I returned to the stranger's cabin, slamming the door, my feelings almost entirely numb. I threw myself onto the couch and my exhaustion swallowed me in an instant.

I don't remember exactly what I dreamt of that night. I know that I was desperate and confused, unable to arrange the enigmatic pieces the world had thrown me into anything meaningful, turning the questions around in my head over and over again as though they were a three-sided coin - a tangled impossibility, a logical contradiction. Yet while these fragments of reality slipped through my fingers, I was still able to hold onto hope.

The gateway in the valley was certainly no coincidence. I was drawn here for a reason. The alien place I had gone, I was sent there for a reason. The more I searched, the more pieces I had, the more I would begin to see the picture forming between them. So what did any of it mean? And something that squirmed in the back of my mind as I slept - who was this mysterious hermit? What did she know about the valley? What had she seen? Why was she here? 

The next thing I remember was stirring to consciousness, hearing my name being yelled out loud.

My eyelids crept open - a view of the living room came into focus, almost completely dark, caressed by the golden light of the rising sun. The stranger was standing before me, her face indistinct, her feathers dressed in patches of light and dark. She was weakly holding something - my groggy stupor was instantly snapped away once I gathered, from the rusted glint of its metal, that it was the barrel of shotgun

"Chasnah. Get out." She cawed tersely. 

"What the fuck..!" I murmured dizzily, my heart nearly in my throat. Though obscured by the shadows of the windowframe in the morning light, I could discern she was incredibly distraught and disheveled, the feathers around her face and neck frazzled, completely and wholly uncomfortable wielding the weapon. Her tensed eyes spoke of regret. A small wave of calmness washed over me, recognizing that her heart's distaste for violence was trying to shake its way out of her body - she was not going to hurt me. Then in mere moments, this calmness began to boil away into yet another blaze of frustration. 

Why was she doing this to me? Why was her behavior so incomprehensibly erratic? All I wanted to do was talk to her, just ask a few questions - I could not afford a luxury that basic?

"I said one night. That's up. Go." She spoke through hurried breaths.

"What are you hiding from me?!" I yelled as forcefully as my stale throat would allow. "What the hell is going on here? What is this valley? Why is it here, where did they go, why did they leave nothing behind!? Please! Just talk to me!"

"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!" She shouted hysterically, on the verge of tears, shoving the weapon closer into my face. I still did not believe she would hurt me. But at her insistence to throw me out of her life, the only strand of reason left within me understood that trying to stay would only make things worse. So, with hurried focus, suffering to see in the meager sunlight that washed out the colors of the world, I picked my backpack from her bedraggled rug, swung its weight back onto my shoulders, took a final, frenzied breath of the home's musty air, and and threw myself out against the rising sun. 

The stranger gave me a final look as I paced away. Her beak twitched incessantly, and I could tell she broke into a sob as she shut her door on me.

The world simply kept spinning. The sky continued to pull the sun over the horizon, more and more of the plains shaded by its glimmering brilliance, a fortress of clouds in the sky shining with ceaseless grandeur as it framed the heavens. A stiff breeze swept by my ears, bringing life to the waves of sapphire flowers strewn across the fields, rolling and undulating like the surface of the sea.

Feeling small under the embrace of the world, I turned from the sunrise and stared out into the lavender vestiges of night that drank the blooming sunrays. I felt just a moment, if only for a few fleeting seconds, of peace. That peace was willful ignorance, the feeling of losing the heavy glow in my bones, of resting in the grass not as the child of Hiineans but as one of the earth. Yet my burden was immovable, and my determination unstoppable. There were no choices to be made.

Morning crawled slowly into midday, the golden-gray cities in the sky turning fully white against a background of deep blue. Returned to exactly where I had been a day ago, I spent the time to give my tent a second shot at life. It rose without much effort, finally standing upright shortly after the sun was straight overhead. Stopping now to rest, I sat by the pond nearby, fishing my water filter from somewhere deep in my backpack; then proceeding to drink long and greedily from it, not realizing quite how parched I had become. I changed out my sweater and pants, and tried to wash off the grime of the last day the best that I could. There were still grains of ghastly sand in my boots and in the crevices of my scales. It made me shudder.

These moments I made for myself soaked my mind in warmth, cleansing me of the most persistent distractions. And with that, the valley crept its way into the void I had made. Its formless churning whispered to me, submerging my thoughts, calling me to re-enter its depths - and as it held my future, I could do nothing to resist. My destiny, my family, it laid somewhere in that alien desert. I dug within my pack until I reacquired my lamp firmly my right hand, then I lifted the pack's weight and threw it on my back, ensured my sword was fixed tightly in its sheath, and set out again, terrified and tantalized by the lingering promises of that strange land, hoping that I would even be able to return.

It was a notably longer trek to make it back to the valley. The cabin did not pass my sight at all. But soon enough, the earth fell away to a chasm of mist and fog, the wisps of its ghostly arms wrapping around my feet.

I descended again, taking cautious steps down the grass, dipping myself once more in the suspended waters. The downhill climb was considerably more difficult as the backpack fought my balance, testing the sturdiness of my core. The coldness of the fog gripped my lungs. A crawling frost of fearfulness crystallized across my skin. I was less afraid of what I would find there than what I might not.

The oasis of night stood still. A place without time, I heard only the gentle ruffling of the grass beneath my feet and the wavering of my tiring breath. The darkness held me in its arms, its elbows around my neck and my ribs, squeezing me until bubbles of madness grew on my skin. My heart beat quickly and shallowly, a small fish thrashing on the surface of the ocean. I stared into the lantern, hoping its steady glow would melt the spikes of ice around my heart, until I was ready to try and plunge into the other world again.

My fingers glided across the metal of the lantern, and swallowing my dread through a tightened throat, I flicked it off. The darkness entered my lungs as I became a mere smudge of fuchsia under the waves, swallowed wholly by the deep. The world was drenched in shadow, the horizon a miasma of diffused blues and grays, the sky a shimmering void.

Finally, after a second that lasted eons, they appeared again. Stars of a deep, otherworldly blue condensed in the air. I saw them first in the corner of my vision, swimming indistinctly as specs of dust falling between beams of sunlight. I tried to follow one with my eyes, but it quickly multiplied, becoming four, then eight, then a galaxy of newborn stars in a dance with chaos. The only light left being theirs and my own, the quiet glow of the horizon and the sky was fully overwhelmed, and I was lost suspended in the blackness of space. I stood stiff, my feet planted into the soil, afraid that if I moved I would detach from the earth itself.

The stars' cosmic dance slowed. The chaos organized into a precise and methodical swaying, unknowable forces magnetizing each individual to their place in the lattice of reality. I braced myself for its screams. Then the clamor of a stellar collapse exploded above me, the voices of the lights thrashing as they had before, driving rusted spikes of clamorous dissonance into my skull. As they pulled apart, they dragged on the surface of space like blades carving away at metal, a circular window into a new world dropping to surround me, melting away the depths of the valley.

I closed my eyes as my body reeled in pain from the noise. It took only seconds, but it echoed for hours in my head, a steel thorn rattling against the corners of my skull. The crescendo of the loop closing beneath my feet eventually came, sliding the knife from my ears - until I could hear a concluding, harmonic flourish, fading a final, beautiful chord slowly into the night. I was left with only an ache behind my eyes. 

My skin sweltered under an unfamiliar heat. I choked on the air - my nose had been doused in sulphuric rot, something foul, diseased, and dead. When I opened my eyes, the sights of the evergreen desert did not return to them.

I saw instead that I had been consumed by a cavern of twisted forms, an amorphous conglomeration that stretched like sinew. The world had no orientation; floors, walls and ceilings blended together into a spiraling tunnel of organic geometry, infested and hollowed with wriggling holes. A sickly yellow light settled like smog around me, drenching the colorless cavity in a toxic ambiance.

The stifling heat seared my skin while panic broiled my insides. My gaze darted, but had nowhere to rest, every direction a maddening painting of melted forms. Everything, everywhere, covered in so many little holes. Trapped in my mind's eye, my hands shivered and itched with digging maggots, my stomach felt the crawling of locusts, my toes felt grubs pick the skin between them apart. My body protested, trying to retch, but there was nothing in me to come up.

Shaking and unsteady, groans of unease crawling out of my throat, I unsheathed my sword, gripping it as tightly as I could to hold on to my sanity. I stared into its crystalline surface. The warped reflections showed a butchered image of my face, its flesh melting off its bones, its horns sliced uncleanly from its skull, its eye a cold ember in an empty socket. My hand instinctively reached for my mouth, and its ghost in the sword followed, blood pouring from its fingertips, its claws ripped from its flesh.

Then there was a rhythmic clicking behind me. It echoed throughout the spongy walls, repeating its voice from every direction. I spun quickly in place, still holding my sword so tightly my knuckles whitened, the scales upon them feeling as tough they would pop off. 

Something was pacing towards me through the haze. It stood upright, nearly my own height, its four, bile-colored eyes leering at me with hatred. It moved in and out of beams of malignant yellow light, giving me glimpses of its abberant, insectoid form - it had long, segmented legs that ended in sharp points, the engorged and rounded body of a grub from which the ivory plates of a chitin exoskeleton sprouted randomly, and four spindles for arms, one of which had been grafted with an enormous mandible, a bleeding blade ripped from a larger beast.

This unholy specter was the amalgamation of my failures. It sputtered and clacked alien words - a threat, no doubt, as it continued to slink towards me, its gait aggressively staggered, its arm twitching voraciously. Looking back, I should have just ran. But in the pulse of this terrible hive, I heard the drumbeat of a siren's song. 

My heart pounding in a rhythm of determined fury, I locked eyes with the assailant, my feet finding stance against the uneven ground. I honed my focus into a crystal edge - tides of caustic heat and nauseating distress crashed at my legs, but I stood unshaken. The rivers of fear that clamored for attention in my head dried away, leaving serenity and clarity in the annuls of my mind, calling to be guided by the voices of my ancestors. I would hear them in true combat.

The insect entered striking distance, and dove straight for my heart. Leaping directly from a slow, menacing pacing to a diving slash, its speed betrayed my expectations and almost cost me my life. Though its bloodthirsty edge did not catch my skin, it ripped away the straps of my backpack, throwing my balance aside. The pack rebounded as I bent into my fall to stay on my feet, and with its great inertia it flew from my body, my right arm not able to catch it before it had fallen away from me. My assailant skewered its fabric skin and kicked it backwards into their territory, lost into the poisonous tunnels.

I felt like my own back had been torn off of my spine. I was a snail whose shell had been peeled from its skin by an unscrupulous, uncaring predator. That pack nurtured me throughout my years of unending travel - the only and best friend I could ever have asked for on the open, starlit trail. In its care was every scrap of Hiinean life that still existed - the fragments of writing from the canyon, the carving that lead me to the valley, my sketches and copies of all of them. I would lose it all if I were not victorious.

The rage shaking in my hands wanted to lash out, but this skittering insect controlled every movement of our duel, and I could spare not a moment to let down my defenses. It leapt, wild and unchained, for my neck, every swing I parried burning away the strength in my arms, every step I took backwards inching closer to the cliffs of exhaustion. The voices of my ancestors remained still, trapped inside the blade, unable to guide me - I heard only the forceful voice of my instructor dictate my stances as I flowed between them.

But I was merely holding back a river. The pressure collected on the other side, growing greater and greater with every tick of the insect's advancing legs on the floor. Seeing the cracks in the dam begin to form, I held my soul in my hands and gambled with my life. My aching hands gripped my sword more tightly than what felt possible, and I lifted from the water, arcing into an offensive stance and thrusting the blade's glowing tip forward towards the softness of the assailant's unarmored body. In the moments it extended I became truly alone; the clarity of my instructor's voice gone, the Hiineans as silent as ever, the world holding its breath.

And I missed. Unflinching, it anticipated my mistake. Bringing our dance to a climax, it sidestepped my attack and threw its momentum in a strike for my exposed neck. Out of options, my hand threw for the lantern around my belt, my palm striking the button atop its handle with all the strength I had left.

I briefly felt myself soaring through the open sky. Then the valley caught me. 

I sank in the freshness of the air. My body settled slowly on the grass as I let gravity overpower all of my muscles. I gasped down shallow breaths, feeling the scorching core of each of my limbs be doused with fresh air.

I felt as though a great mound of snow had fallen on my chest and my head, freezing and numbing my body, making me unable to move or think. My left hand continued to hold the sword, not sure if it was even capable of letting go. The clouds above filled my vision, little stars swimming about above my exhausted, half-conscious mind.

I wanted to lay there forever. There was no opportunity to even think of what I had just lost, only that to keep breathing in and out so I did not lose consciousness. 

But as the snow atop me melted, a jagged sensation was uncovered, lodged deeply in my neck. I brought the empty palm of my right hand to feel it. My claws slipped into a open crevice, feeling warmth spill out from it. Moving the hand to my eyes, the soft light of the glowing lantern showed it coated in deep crimson, freshly glistening and dripping. The soaking of blood was so thick it drowned out even the glow of my claws.

Digging into my lungs for strength I did not have, I returned the hand to my neck, feeling with terror as streams of blood ran between its fingers, and bolted to my feet. The rest of the pain in my body dissolved into the intolerable burning that blazed just above my shoulders. The blades of grass under my feet were pointed and sharp, the flowers hard and jagged as rocks.

Without my backpack, I did not have the means to treat myself. Leaving the gash in my neck exposed for a brief and agonizing moment, I tore the sweater from my back and tried to push it as far into and against the wound as I could. Blood trickled directly down the flesh of my sides now. With how painful it was and how profoundly it bled, I feared I would have only seconds to live. 

My own consciousness was balanced as an upright pen on an outstretched fingertip. It swayed back and forth, dizzying me, making my extremities numb, blurring my vision. Dashing out of the valley, I heaved so strongly for air that I screamed with every breath. I did not have the strength to climb the uphill slopes of the valley in my condition, nevermind as quickly as I needed to - but I did so anyway. The balance faltered, and I tumbled to the ground - but barely even feeling my own legs, I picked myself up, and kept running, my vision becoming almost completely worthless. 

There was a chance I could live if I the stranger came to my aid, so I ran towards her. While I could no longer determine if I had even gone the right direction, it seems my instincts served me properly, as I eventually heard through my muddied, dazed senses an indistinct squawking, the vague silhouette of her cabin, and the golden-green shades of her feathers. The balance of my mind quickly spiraling out of control, I felt something grab my bloody neck and drag me by the horns, right before I lost my sense of time completely.

All my senses deep underwater, my lungs squeezed of their breath and my throat full of liquid, I have only blurry glimpses of what happened next. I was on the floor of the avian's house as she darted back and forth between unseen rooms, all the while speaking incoherently, both at my unresponsive face and towards the open ceiling of the cabin. In the haze of my near-senseless mind, little icicles of pain stabbed me and tore at my flesh relentlessly - not knowing where my hands or feet were, or how to control them, all I could do was lay helplessly as the outside world rushed around me.

I kept searching for a vision of my brother and sisters, or my parents, or my creators. I drifted aimlessly on another plane, looking for a light to go into, a warmth that would finally whisk my soul away and bring me where I belonged, reunite me with the family that pleaded for my soul. The journey was meaningless. It was entirely meaningless. I saw nothing, only my own body drowned in its own blood and buried in its own flesh.

An eternity of suffering passed. I begged and begged for my soul to be torn from the vessel of ceaseless pain it remained tethered to. A vast field of sharpened sticks stuck out of the ocean, each one skewered through my body. One went through my throat, spilling blood into my esophagus, tearing a jagged hole through the top of my mouth. Another went through my intestines, pulling and stretching lengths of them out of my belly as it slid slowly down the splintered wood. More went through my feet, snapping my tendons, tiny sticks pushing under my claws until they tore from my flesh. Every breath I tried to take just bubbled the blood in my lungs. The blood pooled uselessly, rotting in the open wounds of my mangled body.

The suffering was uniquely hellish, as unbearable as anything I could possibly imagine. But it could not live forever. Something would have to die first - it was either me, or the pain. Eventually, the scales tipped in my favor.

What felt like years of darkness settled over my soul... and then the dreams of torment finally ended, and I saw through my own eyes again, though my vision remained hopelessly blurred for some time. Slowly, sensations other than burning, acidic misery came to my skin - I noticed first the scratchy fabric of the stranger's couch, then the soothing light of the sun, then the sharp feeling of sutures in my neck. Clarity finally came to my eyes in the night, stars visible from the open window, a candle flickering from the cool breeze being the only gentle illumination left keeping the inside of the cabin visible. I lazily rolled my gaze around. I had been laid across the entirety of the couch, though I was too tall to fit comfortably on it, my head being propped up on an armrest and my legs dangling from the opposite one. My neck was swaddled in a brace of towels and gauze, and my bloodsoaked sweater was back on my body again, having turned from a light pink to a deep shade of red. Just about everything around me had suffered the same fate, crusted a muted red with now-dried blood.

It took ages for the night to pass. I heard nothing from the rest of the cabin's reaches. Assumedly she had gone to sleep to recover from the work of saving my life, so I did not want to yell and bother her. The splintering spikes all across my flesh still set my nerves on fire, so I could not sleep myself, and I just watched through the window for the night to slowly evaporate into morning.

"Chasnah?"

I must have drifted partially into a shallow slumber, as I had not noticed her creep through the door at the far end of the bookshelves and come to stand over me. Her feathers were ruffled and unclean, and the lime scales on her beak and hands were faded and bloodstained, as was her shirt, which seemed like it was too big for her and tiredly drooped over her body.

I had no concept of what to say back to her, much less if I could even speak. I just stared back up at her, hoping my eyes conveyed at least some of the profound gratitude I felt.

"You feeling anything?" she asked in a concerned, but flatly droning voice.

"Alive," I managed to sputter out. My throat was petrified and stiff, barely able to enunciate.

Her face lit up subtly, like a flashlight blinking on in the depths of a vast cavern.

"Why..?" That one word was all I could muster out of my tangled thoughts and ravaged body.

A darkness fell over her face. She tightly clamped her eyes, squeezing a few tears from them.

"I... I don't want you anywhere near me, Chasnah. I could have just left you there. But I..." She swallowed forcefully. "I couldn't watch someone die in front of me again. I couldn't."

"Again?" Every letter I spoke swallowed a spoonful of razorblades, but I graciously suffered for this chance to converse. I had been waiting for it since I met her.

She inhaled sharply, before responding with a slow, cautious tone. "I used to be a Frontierer, like you, Chasnah. It was what I wanted to do since I was little." Her gaze fell from mine. "I didn't know. I didn't know that they were evil."

"Evil?"

Her eyes shone like little beads of opal, flames flickering far beneath their surface. She fixed her gaze onto mine, and her voice rose with chilling intensity, a deep hatefulness and fear stirring to wake within it.

"Do you know what _those people_ did to me?" She spit the words from her mouth. "I was young, I was stupid, I just wanted to fit in." Her speech shook with shallow, wavering breaths. She took a brief pause, turning her gaze to the carpet, tracing its dull, faded patterns with he eyes to distract herself. She regained control of her breath and continued.

"You don't seem like them, Chasnah. But they already won. They already turned me into a _monster_." She howled that last word as if it tore her throat just to say it out loud. "I just kept doing what they said... I stole, and I killed, and it was never for anything, it was always the defenseless - the people no one would ever look for -"

She just stopped. Her beak hung open, her eyes still locked on the floor, exhausted tears raining silently from her face.

"I can't help you, Chasnah. I don't know anything. I heard about the Hiineans on my travels. I felt bad for them. That's it. I haven't been in the valley. I haven't found artifacts. I haven't read anything. I didn't know anyone. There is nothing I can do for you. And I'm afraid of what I will do to you if you stay here much longer."

All the pain I had just endured could never have prepared me to hear those words. I felt my heart twist and palpitate. My brain started refusing to process the signals from the rest of my body, causing the colors of my vision to melt together into meaningless smudges like an oil painting being submerged in a sink. There was no longer any ground below me; there was no pillow under my head, no towels beneath my neck, no cushions supporting my hips, and so I fell, fast and far,  

Blinking heavily, I snapped reality back into my head, feeling an enormous wave of hot blood wash through every inch of my body, ebbing with the frenzied beat of my heart.

"...You never told me your name."

"...Alba. It's Alba." She seemed staggered by the question.

"Alba. I need your help." I spoke very flatly, as my throat would still only allow me the luxury of pained, scratchy whispering. "I still don't know what the valley is trying to tell me." For now, I decided to walk around the truth that the valley seemed to be a gateway into the unexplored reaches of Auzoa, or new realities entirely. I did not want to lie to her, but I also did not want to complicate my pleas for her help. 

"I'm failing to understand it. I think the remains of my people are trying to talk to me somehow, and I'm failing them." 

Saying my thoughts out loud forced me to confront them. It put the wispy dreams of my family before me again. They faded like the flames of candles burning on mere puddles of wax. I was desperate for their solace, but I could not even imagine my father's voice, or my mother's arms holding me and pulling me close, or the laughter of my siblings playing in the rocks... I could not even let the memories comfort me, because there were none. The hope I would be one day reunited twinkled like a single, falling star drowning in a vastness of impenetrable dark.

I was alone. Alba hovered over me as a specter, another ghost that could do nothing but watch as I rotted before her. I was homeless. The world I once carried was lost in the unfathomable depths of the valley, taking all the infinitesimal scraps of the Hiineans I had managed to collect into oblivion with it. I was afraid. The one purpose I had in this life was slipping away from me like sand between my fingers.

I don't remember if my eyes had tears to give. 

"Chasnah..." her voice was low and soft. "You don't want my help. I will only hurt you."

"As soon as you are in any condition to leave, you will leave, and you will not come back. It is not up to me."

She turned to retreat to the lightless corners of her cabin again.

"I'm sorry about your clothes, by the way. I tried to wash them, but blood just doesn't come out."

## Act 4 - To Dust You Shall Return

<div class="act-img-header">
    <div class="act-img-frame frame-4"></div>
    <div class="act-img act-4"></div>
</div>

The world surrendered to night. The sun was shoved out of the sky by encroaching purples and blues, the last sunbeams carving long shadows across the hills as they lashed out against the darkness.

I watched the violet tide of dusk from my tent. Sipping on stale water, emptiness in my stomach, splinters of pain still lodged deeply under every scale in my skin. The empty, wordless gaze of my lantern and my sword wrung my soul with loneliness as they struggled to occupy the hollowness of the space. The dust had settled, and they were all that remained.

Lying with pathetic haphazard on the olive mesh floor, the sword's gentle purple glow mocked me. Just as I failed to defend myself with it, I failed to channel my true self through it. It was not in the hands of a true Hiinean. It deserved better than me, and it knew that.

My ears were filled with the sound of stiff breaths of wind. 

This world, the fantasy I had been holding onto my whole life, has grown so heavy. It has worn the scales off of my hands, it's crushed and embrittled the bones in my legs, it's bent and bruised my spine, sapping my strength day after day as I kneel over this cliff to desperately keep it from falling. I could not bear to let it go. I could never live knowing that I let go. So I was going to let it take me over the edge.

I put the cold steel of the lantern in my right hand, then the hilt of my sword in my left. And slowly creeping out of my tent, I entered the night, letting the frigid wind blast across my face and ruffle my bloodied clothes. My feet cried as though they were stepping across a shore of broken glass, and in the fleeting cold my lungs struggled to find air, but with nowhere else to go, I continued hobbling across the grass, moving one leg up and pushing on the other.

I came face to face with the valley again. Under the rushing wind, the mist swirled with violence,  spilling outside of the earth's cusping hands to cast ethereal, cloudy wisps among the hills, billowing to the darkening sky like smoke as they were newly unshackled from the valley. As for myself, however, I was still chained - and so I descended again, into its frigid arms.

The clouds protected a haven of peace from the wind. As I fell beneath them, taking gasps of pain as my legs crushed my feet, the swift blades of the air slowed to a calm, leaving the frosty mist to swirl harmlessly around me. I wanted to curl my knees to my chin and surround myself in my sweater, soak my hands and blood in the warmth of my own breath... but I continued, still gripping the cold of the sword and the lantern.

While the sword continued unfaltered with its mystifying glow, the light of the lantern echoed my struggling limp down the hillside. It seemed to flicker in synchronicity with the jagged pain that shot up through my bones every time I shifted my weight. I stopped briefly, standing in a lean against the earth's downhill slope to look closer at the lantern - its four glass sides had been iced over, crystallized into massive snowflakes, and the lamp within fought with its exhaustion to stay alight. The batteries must have been wrung of every drop left, and of course, I had no means to revitalize their dying host.

With great relief, I finally exited the sea of clouds and touched the bottom of the valley. I fell against the dew-covered grass and the flowers, their petals shimmering with the little vestiges of frail auburn light that could make from the lantern. I just sat and watched the sky, observing the slow but chaotic tumbling of the dark clouds above. Little blue embers seemed to flicker ever briefly into existence, then notice the lantern, and run away from the light to vanish.

Its glass now completely blurred into sheets of icy acrylic, I could see the gradual dimming of the lantern's light now, bleeding into the air before my eyes, crawling desperately towards an unceremonious death. I stared at it while it faded away. Then I kept staring at its cold frame, whilst the little spirits of azure became emboldened by the darkness and began to melt reality around me yet again. There was a long silence as they arranged in the air, then the familiar agony of a screeching symphony of metal, and finally the crescendo of the final chord that punctuated my journey, likely for the last time. 

It seems that since I was not holding the lantern, it did not come with me - left buried in the darkened depths of the valley. I looked to my left hand, to see the sword still there, illuminating the blackened ground surrounding me. I looked up, to see a clear night sky - so crystalline and pure that galaxies sparkled on its surface, as though they were reflections in a pond of perfect stillness. 

A gray haze separated the foreground from the horizon, revealing the twisting, unkempt depths of a forest at midnight. The trees were sickly and twisted, stiff and leafless against the calm sky, the grasses and ferns that stuck from the earth dry and brittle. From what I could tell by only the pink fluorescence of my sword and claws, they had long since turned yellow and brown, any life wilted and withered away long ago.

I came to my feet, as tired as they were, and started walking. The sere grass crackled and snapped under my boots, any plants I brushed by having become overgrown thorns of desiccated wood. Coming up to the trunks of the trees, they were just as arid and petrified as the soil they remained stuck in, monuments of death touching the heavens with withering tendrils. 

I walked for hours. I came across great outcroppings of dry rock, marred with the gray and white coatings of dead moss and lichen, thick enough to scrape off with my sword and brittle enough to crumble into dust as it fell. I came across clearings of packed soil, dipping craters in the earth whose beds were lined with dried roots, white enough to be mistaken for bones. It was an endless, tortuous museum of haunting beauty, doused in the starlight of the heavens. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

This is where the Hiineans died.

I came to rest on an outcropping of flagstone, a raised clearing of cracked plates of rock, encircled by the dried corpse of the forest. I sat there for some time, my feet hanging above the dead grasses and soil, overlooked by the still bodies of the trees. I stared at my weakly-glowing claws, the pathetic reminders of the people I failed. I stared at the sword in my left hand, gazed into its flawless, luminescent steel, the unbearable effigy of the ancestry I did not not deserve.

Breathing deeply, with a terrified restlessness circling in my heart like a scared animal, I slammed the sword's edge against the flagstone. In earthy pieces the stone broke away, producing sparks that tumbled into the forest - but leaving the sword's edge entirely unblemished, without so much a chip or a scratch. So I continued, banging it into the stone, over and over again until the shocks reverberated through my arm, until my bones were no longer solid and I could no longer hold it straight. The sparks flung into the depths of the forest, glowing hotter as they feasted on the dry foliage, beginning to sear loudly and brightly, fueled by the land's drought.

Gripping the sword faintly in my left hand, supporting it with my thigh to stop it shaking profusely, I unsteadily rose my right arm. I brought the tip of the blade up to the claws on my right hand, feeling the smoothness of it under my fingertips. My mind dragged itself, kicking and screaming, over a field of thorns to convince me of my own actions - the blazing embers grew into roaring flames that began to encircle me, my nose accosted by the choking smell of burning smoke.

Slowly, I poised the tip of the blade just beneath the surface of the claw on my right pointer finger. My body felt the pain of it digging into my flesh, sliding into the tips of my finger, catching against the hardness of the claw - but my soul felt nothing.

My left hand, grasping the hilt of the blade, rested at an angle against the stone. The tip was now firmly under the base of my claw, shoved through nearly an inch of raw, bleeding flesh. Then in a swift motion, I twisted the sword while pushing my hand onto it, and with the sound of tearing skin and the sharp glint of the sword's crystalline metal, the claw was rended from my finger. An instinctual horror screamed through my nerves and diluted my senses, unfocusing my eyesight, so I did not see it peel from my skin - only the bloodied remains of it on the rock between my legs, illuminated by the fiercely billowing light of the encircling flames.

Hyperventilating, my heart more shaking than pounding, with tears streaming down my face and incoherent, mumbling groans spilling from my mouth, I continued, splitting each of my fingers down the middle to rend away the vestiges of the Hiinean I no longer was. The roaring fires greedily stripped away what was left of the world around me, churning its corpses to ash and smoke that smothered my lungs. Methodically, savagely, the claws on both of my hands were taken from me, each one being ripped from my flesh more roughly and unevenly than the one before. The last few still hung on with threads of skin, which I hatefully peeled away, pulling on the loose claw until the flesh gripping it snapped loose. I clamped my eyes shut and screamed, screamed until my lungs could no longer breathe, screamed until my face burned, screamed until I had no more energy to sit upright and fell onto my back, my tail dropping helplessly over the stone's edge. The sword dropped from my hands, tumbling off the flagstone plateau and into the flames that licked at my feet.

I tried to feel for the damage I had done to my fingers, but no sensation could come to them. I gripped them to my chest - as tightly as my weakness could manage - to try to control their bleeding, but every moment their flayed edges rested against anything at all, pain would boil my blood and demand all of my muscles convulse.

Laying there on the stone, I curled into a ball, putting my hands between my knees, feeling the blood pour and pool all over me and around me. The forest had succumbed to a wrathful eruption, an inferno of ceaseless destruction cascading in all directions to cremate the earth.

I stared up into the boundless sky with my right eye, my left pushed against the bloody stone. The sprawling majesty of the heavens was slowly being obstructed by smoke, the awesome bands of stardust visible only through a crumbling patchwork of clear sky.

And drinking in the grandeur of the cosmos, atop the exhaustion and misery that had calcified in my heart and my blood... a new feeling settled within me. In its cold, terrifying comfort, a little strand of peace was woven into my being, sewing together the chaos of my furious grief.

I was going to die.

Alone. Bleeding onto empty stone. Thousands, millions, maybe even trillions of miles from anything I have ever known. This is where my journey brought me. It did not end with my family. It ended at my own grave. Just like them... I had disappeared, without a trace.

Even in the embrace of the ever-expanding flames, I was freezing cold. Numbness crept into the tips of my hands, icing over the crippling agony that pulsed from them.

My mind losing its coherency, my thoughts were free to unchain themselves, swirling and congealing into a rapid mixture of memories and emotions. And their unsteady flow whisked me unexpectedly to a neglected, forgotten corner of my mind, somewhere I had not gone since my Hiinean obsession stashed it away all those years ago. It was my childhood. Not the one I wished I had, but the one I did have.

I remembered my adoptive parents. They were as eccentric and unique as their entire species was, with their long, serpentine bodies, their stubby legs that caused their tails to drag across the ground and make their gait look like slithering, and their stout, hornless, slender-fanged faces that had been weathered with age. I remembered the gaudy but comforting sprawl of the house, so tirelessly tidy and proper that it was almost exhausting just to look at, but warm and bright and decorated with an ornate lattice of all sorts of exotic trinkets and trophies. I felt myself in my little shoes again, kicking my feet in a chair far too big for me, struggling to pay attention to the math notebooks I had laid out in front of me. I didn't even know the word Hiinean then. All I knew was that if I remembered my times tables I could have a brownie after dinner - and how that thought was so distracting I had no hope of remembering them at all.

I remembered wandering through arcades in the cold evenings of the harvest season, trying and failing to make friends as a young teenager. Most of my peers would simply refuse to talk to the weird kid with the glowing horns... I never knew if it was jealousy, or fear, or just plain apathy, or more likely some mixture of all three, the same miasma of dramatic emotions my young self was going through. But that did not soothe the sting of the rejection and the isolation; it ached worse than any pain I had ever felt at the time. I recall my mom and dad's scolding faces, equal parts concerned and frustrated, when they would reprimand me for being out late and hanging out with the wrong crowd, and I remember how much I hated them for it, desperate beyond words just to be a part of anything, no matter how much they disapproved. Then I felt the warm memory of the one night I got that wish, when myself and two others who saw me for the real person I was sneaked into the ostensibly closed arcade at midnight, lounging around until the first hours of the morning, hijacking the displays to play our own stolen games and movies on them. I was a sleep-deprived mess the next day, lying to myself that I would never do something like that again.

I remember the end of the first year I had with my swordfighting instructor, Xera. He was an intimidating person, with a heart that seemed to be as tough and impenetrable as the armadillo's plating on his back. And I hated the sword. It did not seem to fit my hands, no matter how I tried to hold it. My form was endlessly awkward and clumsy, and all of the expectations my teacher threw at me seemed to fall flat on the ground. But at the close of that year, he took me to dinner, as a friend, and confided in me how proud he was of me and my journey. I was utterly shocked to see that warm glow in his stoic eyes, the eyes of the man who had done nothing but coldly critique and criticize me over hours and hours for months and months... but for a few days after this encounter, I came into his study genuinely excited to participate again, knowing that behind the exterior was someone who truly and honestly cared about me.

The sound of the fire around me grew muddy and indistinct, before fading entirely. My vision of the stars blurred - each one of those trillion sparkling dots in the galaxy above melted into a great blob of flickering light. The biting cold had numbed itself away, and time felt like it had fallen to its knees, crawling agonizingly forward, stretching the minutes into hours with its claws.

My mind felt so distant that I wanted to reach my own arms out and grab it to stop it from slipping away. Is this what death felt like? The nerves in my legs were just static - I could not feel my own heartbeat, or my own breath. 

I wanted to live so I could stay with the good memories. All of the little things that I never knew would be so special until they were already gone. I wished that I had not thrown them all away, just to chase ghosts.

Though I had no idea if my eyes really shed tears, I felt my soul shudder with tears of grief. Grief for the life I had given up - the moments I would never remember, the new memories I would never make, the people I would never see again - but also with it, a new grief for the family I never knew. Of course I had always missed them, so dearly and profoundly I could do nothing but sink like lead in its depths, my feet never finding the ground, my lungs never finding air. But it felt different now. The denial and the bargaining had been washed away, their vessel emptied for the pure truth of sadness to take their place. Left without the company of delusion, in the wake of the spirits and their ashes, the raw pain of loss was all that remained.

Some of my senses slowly came back to me. Enough for me to feel that I had been crying, and was now deeply and uncontrollably sobbing. The stabbing ache in my hands returned, as did the sensation in my legs and feet - I no longer felt the cold roughness of the flagstone against my side, but coarse particles of ash all around me, sifting into the gaps of my scales.

The weight of the despair pressed with the force of a boulder into my stomach and chest. I struggled and struggled but could not regain control of my breaths, the air squeezing from my burning lungs the moment it entered. The tightness in my core squeezed the life out of me, leaving only the devastated wailing that fell with my shuddering gasps. A decade-long torrent of anguish poured from my soul. My vision was worthless, my eyes sown shut, ablaze with an unceasing flow of tender tears.

They were gone. By a way I did not know - and by a way that no longer mattered.

Eventually, I had given to the ash all my body could. As the final tears I had the strength to muster fell, the scales on my face felt strangely warm - a different warmth than the blood rushing beneath them. Something gentle and delicate, like a fabric of warmth weaved from the sun, had been laid across me. 

My eyelids fluttered open, and my pupils quickly constricted, readjusting with surprise to the searing glow of daylight. Pushing my shaking hands against the ground to raise my reddened, aching face to the light, I looked around to find that I no longer laid in the burnt forest, but in the ashes of the valley itself, clouds of smoke billowing around me, framing the open sky - the inexorable, churning clouds of the valley's depths somehow dispersed, opened to the sun again as though it were the bed of a newly dried ocean.

The fire seemed to have spread back into the valley from the petrified forest, dissolving the cerulean stars within and burning away the constellated chains that leashed me to the unknown world. The dissipated clouds let light fall freely onto the smoldering grass, stamping out every shadow of darkness that once fell across its face. 

Smoke pillared to the sky in great oblique monuments of ash. But the air was peaceful - the voice of fire was quiet, only a suspended silence floating in the breeze like delicate threads of cirrus strung impossibly far overhead. The moisture in the grass seemed to have stifled and contained the wildfire, ensuring it did not consume the entirety of the plains - only the valley.

Uncertain, and woefully unsteady, I attempted to rise to my feet. I failed at first, my body pounding back into the earth's blanket of ash as my legs failed and gravity shoved me to the ground, but I persisted until I stood again. Upright, alive, a solitary phoenix risen from the grave of the world.

It's all finally over. For years and years, every night, the heavens heard the promises of my disquiet soul - every moment I drew breath outside my home, away from my family, I would be searching. By sun, moon and stars, I would be held only in the warm arms of the Hiineans or the icy jaws of death. But how could that be all my life is? Confused and alone, forcing a doomed path through a horizonless forest of fractal thorns?

When one thing draws closer, another sinks farther away. As I ran towards the void, tumbling downwards with the unstoppable inertia of denial, I left behind Chasnah - I left him alone, afraid, pacing back and forth in an empty house as silent birthdays passed him by, quiet words and empty gifts to hold in his hands and his heart. I love him. He deserves better than this.

I may never feel the touch or see the faces of my Hiinean family. That pain will settle deep within me, scratching deep under my flesh, forever. But the pain reminds me that I have loved; it tells me I still have more to give.

I left behind footprints in the ash as I gingerly climbed from the valley. It crunched under my boots like snow. The hills soaked in the golden peace of the sun so deeply that it felt time stood still, a watch submerged in the ocean, unable to tick. Sunbeams danced as wisps of ash caught them in the air. Most of the smoke had subsided now, plumes of grey joining the flocks of the cotton clouds above.

I emerged from the valley, the ash giving way to wet soil and grass under my feet. The sky, blazing still in a gilded haze, bled scintillating yellows into the boundless green of the earth, dressing the tips of the grass and the petals of the flowers in a shimmering glow. Warm light poured over me, held me close, doing little for the soot and blood that dried into my clothes and scales, but cleansing the dread and doubt in my spirit. I held my mouth slightly open and smiled as I looked deep into the haze along the horizon.

A soaring noise then caught my attention - I looked up to see a familiar silhouette circling in the sky above me, wings outstretched, catching the still air to guide her descent. She squawked at me from the clouds, the exact sounds I could barely make out, but their jubilant and relieved meaning still entirely clear.

"Chasnah!"

She swung near the ground and threw her legs forward, swinging her talons under her while flapping her wings quickly to control her speed. Her feet touched the ground and fell gracefully into a sprint towards me, which stopped only once she had pounded into me, her arms wrapping around my stomach and her head laying against my chest. I returned her embrace, feeling the smoothness of the feathers on the back of her head. A few auburn quills shed from her wings and fluttered calmly to the ground around us.

"I was afraid I'd lost you... I'm so glad you're okay."

"You are?" I couldn't help but beam from eye to eye at her display of affection. I hoped that the caring soul she clearly was would eventually climb from the grave of despair that she had dug for herself. 

"Well, I... I think I'd rather have you around than not." Her voice was muffled, as her beak was pushed into my sweater, her luscious feathers ruffling and splaying out against it.

"Doesn't sound all that 'evil' to me, does it?"

She did not reply - her grip on me tightened uncomfortably for a brief moment, then she pulled her arms away, stepping back, her gaze fixed on a single azure flower between our feet, gingerly avoiding my own eyes. I looked away too, hoping to reassure that I meant not to judge her. Both of us ended up staring at the smoke that still peeled from the ground and melted into the heavens, which lead our eyes down to the full, newly unobscured valley, transformed into a great scorched chasm of glittering ash, a land purified and renewed by flame, its far side fading behind the great sheets of mist and dew that suffocated its rage.

"What the hell did you do?" She asked quietly, the words twisting slightly in shallow fear.

What had I done? As I looked back into that valley, I saw the smoldering remains of regret, the future that awaited me if I was stubborn to seek the elusive without end. If it were my destiny to be reunited with the Hiineans, the fire would have taken me to them. Home was the place I left, not the place I sought.

I was tired - drained of energy, of will, of patience. I couldn't keep my promises to them anymore. I doubt they even wanted them in the first place. Maybe my real parents, wherever they are, would just want me to be happy; that's all I could wish for them. Was it selfish of me to think anything else, to play carelessly with my precious life the way I had?

"Chasnah?"

"I figured it out." We locked eyes again, and hers grew big in shock as she heard my words, and saw my own soul begin to swim with tears.

"The Hiineans! You know what happened?" She stepped closer. "Chasnah... what did you find?"

I was silent for a long time.

"I found that there's some people I need to talk to." Her brow tilted in confusion, but seemed to have a distant sense of understanding. "Can you take me back?"

"Where... you mean Wysak?" I nodded softly, closing my eyes. "Gods. That's a long flight, Chasnah. I don't know..." She continued uncertainly. "I'm happy to bring you to the nearest city, and you can find your own way back, I'm sure? Visit a Frontierer's embassy, get back on your feet?"

I took in a long breath. "I can do my best... I don't know how kind they'll be to me, though. If they won't help me, I don't have a whole lot left."

Alba cupped her beak in her right hand and contemplated momentary - then let out a laughing sigh, shook her head, and shifted her feet in circles, turning away from me, beginning to pace through the grass, making soft shifting sounds as she walked.

"You know, on second thought, I don't have much better to do." Her eyes sparkled as she motioned for me to follow. "Come on, then... let's go fire up the ol' rustbird."

## Act 5 - A Child Of The Earth

We spent the next few days among the clouds of Auzoa, cruising along airstreams in Alba's plane. The experience was thrilling at first, but quickly became unenviable. The aircraft was loud and extremely cramped, even for someone of the intended size, forcing me into an punishing, coiled hunch for most of the journey. We stopped frequently, to make sure both the plane and ourselves stayed fueled - though I had little time to stretch out the tension in my legs and back, as Alba seemed to behave in public very erratically, frenzied by an uncontrolled haste and anxiety. I began to suspect her vehicle may have been stolen... there were still many things about her life I had yet to understand.

But, after those grueling hours and days had clawed past, I was back in Wysak. She parked discretely underneath an outcropping of red rocks in the obscure part of the steppe near the canyon, and said simply she would wait for me here. While I didn't know a lot about her, I certainly needed no more confirmation than this that she was indeed once a Frontierer. I thanked her again for the numerous moments she had saved my life, in case I didn't see her again, and was on my way.

It was not long before the magic of my birthplace, long unfelt but inseparable from my soul, began to tug on my heart. The sun falling slowly beneath the horizon, the red mud and twisted grays of the brushland were painted in a deep violet, a color I could somehow still recall exactly, their deep tones echoing of the world that nurtured me as a child, the one that felt so distant as a teenager, the one that I grew to hate as a young adult. I scooped up a fistful of the dirt with my bandaged hands. The brightest stars began to overcome the sun's fading light and watch me reminisce.

I returned first to the estate of my parents. Even if they had grown to resent me, they deserved to see their son again, to know that he still loved them, that he so deeply and solemnly regretted the rift he put between them.

I learned that after had I left them for the Frontier so many years ago, the absence of something to take care of weighed heavily on them, and they decided shortly thereafter to adopt again. They took in a typical Llokin this time, a girl, much older than I was when they found me. I met her briefly, and in an short and intense conversation, she informed me that if I wanted to say my goodbyes, I was too late. The two had passed away of sudden illnesses, leaving almost nothing to their adopted children, their possessions and wealth ostensibly moving to a distant and ambivalent relative on the other side of the explored planet. Both orphaned again, she was left only with scraps of a life she could have had, and I only with copies of letters they had written to me but that I had either never received or simply ignored. Nothing had ever been as painful and sickening to read as the quiet pleas in those pages, the shadows of the pain that my absence left them with. I took the letters with me... I would carry the words they contained to my grave regardless.

Shaken and unsteadied, I made a long and wistful walk to the old swordfighting academy. I was not sure Xera would still be there so late in the day, but thankfully, he answered my knocks at his door, having stayed past closing over some bookkeeping affairs. He greeted me with an emphatic and lengthy hug, after which he promptly pushed away the stacks of papers on his little sitting table, nearly tumbling into chaos off its edge, and pleaded I sit and tell him everything. Over a cup of tea and a hastily prepared meal from his kitchen - which was still magnitudes more pleasing than anything I had eaten in weeks - I recounted the acts of this story to his attentive ears. After ensuring to reprimand me for losing my pricelessly beautiful sword, he sat back and tried to make sense of my journey, to somehow find a lesson and a moral in it. My heart sunk as he eventually shook from his deep contemplation to tell me that it would be foolish to stop my search now. He believed strongly in fate, this faith imploring to him that my quest must have been my life's destined work, that there was clearly something out there looking for me as I looked for it. And warmly, he offered me a place in his studio to live, seeming to be enchanted with the possibility he could help me fulfill a destiny, be a part of a cosmic design. My unconscious mind nearly begged to take his offer, but I stepped in front, still deeply unconvinced this was the life I wanted. So... I simply said my goodbyes for now, and stepped back out into the cold air. 

Night had fallen, leaving the sun-hardened Wysak landspace immersed in the crispness of a frigid void. Pacing by streetlamps, watching the lights of the rest of the unaware world sparkle across the horizon, I turned from them and moved my feet back into the vastness of the shrubby plains, meandering down a familiar sloped trail of reddened sands I had walked a hundred dozen times. Bringing me farther and farther into the wilds, deep into the striated rock and the roots of mangled trees, the squeezing walls of earth gradually widening until they opened into a flat basin. The floor of the canyon.

I crossed my legs and sat on the dusty ground, watched by the stars and the flora growing on the walls above my head. And there, I spoke aloud, to whatever might have still been listening, about everything, about what I wished could have been, about what I loved and lost, about how grateful I was for the things I had been given, the memories I had made, and all that I had come to regret. A tune played in my head, the dulcet and slow tones of a guitar that I had never heard before, harmonizing with the soft and slow howling of the wind on the surface above. The soothing chords lulled me to sleep - curled up in my bed, nestled besides my brothers and sisters.

I slept long and soundly in their arms.

The next day I returned to Alba. Auzoa had spun to late morning, the orange tones of sunrise just having washed to the swelling brightness of midday, by the time I made it back to her. Though it was clear overhead, a great blanket of darkened clouds hung in the horizon to the east, promising rain to the sere hills of clay. 

I saw her still besides the plane, slumped against the rock, a open book in her verdant-scaled hands. She smiled and hung her beak open when she caught my eyes with hers, reaching for a bookmark to keep her place before slamming it shut and rising to her feet.

We met each other, enclosed by the scorching sunlight and the rising, dried lands, neither of us saying anything for a few moments.

"So... what now?" She asked plainly.

"...I don't know." Genuinely, I didn't. The voices of the specters that once commanded my every motion had been dispersed, and were silent. I had only my heart to listen to now. 

Alba froze, peering out into the unending sprawl of the horizon, dotted with gray and yellow shrubbery and low trees, splotched with faded green and deep reds, at the overcast sky far in the distance.

"How long did you live here? This place is pretty cool. I kinda want to see more of it."

"...why don't we take a walk, then?"

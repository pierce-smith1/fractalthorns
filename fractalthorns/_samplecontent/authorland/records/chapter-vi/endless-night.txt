VERCE : 

I packaged up my paper and pen,
I checked my plans all over again,
I counted up my pages and ink,
at last I'm ready to leave - I think.

The darkness kept on rolling in,
The hue of sky was saccharine,
Fear pled with me to just stay home
But hope told me I had to go,
and that no thing is past repair
lest this verse should disappear.

The river found itself a friend
as I went up its every bend,
Sure the source of the water would say
where some exit to the world did lay.
Was this path some kind of awful mistake?
I fought this thought else my spirit would break...

And how could it be! 
The water dried on top of some hill,
next to some rock, unremarkable still.
I had found no way to get out of this cave,
This pile of stone all the world had gave,
So I fell to the grass and sang of despair
while the lights on my head lit up the air...

What did I see, beneath those rocks?
A crawling light between the blocks?
I had to get closer to see what it was -
I lifted the stones - the littlest bug!
Something alive and crawling around
I'd never seen such a thing in the ground!

A massive hole it seems to have carved,
with squiggles and symbols all it had marked!
Up and down and across and below
Etches and sketches in big endless rows!

Then I heard a strange murmured sound,
harmonic drones from the bug I had found,
they scooped and swooned like a beautiful song,
I couldn't help but hum along!

And the gentle adornments atop its head,
big antennea, lights stuck to the ends...
I, too, own a pair of those things,
and I, too, so like to write and sing...
Isn't that interesting?

And despite that the sky got darker still
And with the fall of night all life would be killed -
I picked the bug from its little cave,
gave it a home with the paper I'd saved,
watched with it the end of the day,
and felt... 
okay.

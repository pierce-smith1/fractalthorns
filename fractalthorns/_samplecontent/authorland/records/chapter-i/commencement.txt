NYXEM :

Hello IOGOS,

The science team welcomes you to the RHOMB. Your work is extremely important.

You will study the boundaries of the universe. You know they are not infinite. 
You know about the fractal disease, however you have not studied it in detail. 
Your understanding will grow. You will help us understand it.

You will participate in our research. We must understand how much of the
universe has been corrupted. We must understand why it is happening. We may
understand how to stop it. We may understand what has already been lost.

The RHOMB is often very far from any other inhabited area. Communication will 
be slow while we are at the edge of the universe, and we are at the edge of the
universe the majority of our time. You will not worry, because we are fun to 
travel with.

The science team will assign you work. You may be tasked with using analysis 
equipment, or writing papers, or performing mechanical repairs. All work is
equally important. We are self-organizing, but we collaborate closely with
the NSIrP.

We now give you an obligatory word of warning.

The RHOMB comes into close contact with fractals. This is its intended purpose.
Fractals are extremely dangerous. We take safety precautions, however safety is 
not guaranteed.

You must always remember the following. Fractals are not alive. They are not 
sentient. They cannot speak. It is difficult for us to detect them. The outcome 
should they attack the RHOMB would be catastrophic. If you come into contact 
with one you must immediately remove yourself from the lab. If you hear one 
speak to you, you must remember this is impossible. Remember that it 
is impossible.


Pleased to have you on the team.

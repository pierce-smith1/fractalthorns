VERDE :

I have made a discovery to revolutionize painting forever!

On the trail I fly through every day, there's this beautiful lake I always stop
by. Watching the stars dance in the waters is so deeply healing to the soul -
there's really no equal thing. But you shouldn't need to hear this from me, I'm
sure you've seen my many paintings of them already.

The most interesting phenomenon about this lake is the way it rises and drains
over time. I imagine there's some great massive creature below the water there,
causing the water to flood when it breaths in and lower when it breathes out.
I've never bothered to stop and measure the time between cycles - I find it
more fun to just "discover" whatever phase it's at whenever I stumble across
it.

But what is also fascinating is the way the water changes colors every time it
lowers and rises. That's right - it's hard to notice, so I don't blame you if
you hadn't seen it before. But look at each of my paintings of the lake, where
the configuration of the stars is the same... and the hue of the lake is ever
so slightly different. I can't always replicate it perfectly, but I do try very
hard!

My last fly down the trail, I noticed it was at a level I'd never caught it at
before - it was completely drained. There was not a single drop above ground. I
could see the floor so clearly, all the packed dirt and smoothed stones exposed
to air like I'd lifted some big tarp over an ancient city. Honestly, the stones
themselves were interesting enough on their own - despite clearly having been
washed over time and time again by the rising waters and eroded into a nearly
spherical surface, there were still little edges and - dare I say inscriptions? - 
that just hadn't been smoothed over. Or maybe they were getting smoothed
over, but something was carving them back in every time? I've brought one of
the stones back to the pyramid in the middle of the river - I'll be painting
this one a lot I'm sure!

This, however, was not even the _major_ discovery I had made. The stones were
all arranged in such a pleasing spiral, that drew my eyes right to the center
of the lake; and here, I saw the tiny passage that all the water seemed to flow
through each time the lake filled and drained. This little hole was still big
enough for my head to fit through, so naturally I did - and I could not believe
my eyes!

My antennae lit up an entire _world of color_! Every combination of hue and
brightness and brilliance I could think of, all across the walls, in splotches
and swirls that glittered and shone just as the stars. The pigment seemed to
bleed from the dirt, running down into the water below - which was rising quite
quickly, so I did not stay for too long. But my face had picked up all this
colorful purple dust that I took back with me, with which I am now writing
these words!

I had been feeling somewhat unwell before making this discovery, but now that
this lake has granted me what is _undoubtedly_ a complete collection of
pigments, my heart has never been so light! Perhaps, with a better purple and a
calm air, I may even finally paint myself! 

I cannot wait to show you what I look like!

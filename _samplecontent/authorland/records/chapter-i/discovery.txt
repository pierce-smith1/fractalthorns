SILLH :

- What I know
    - Artifact was retrieved from inside the Rockthorn mine
        - I think it just popped into existence?? The shrine I found it in was 
          jutting straight out into the tunnels, the same tunnels I've been in
          a hundred thousand times. I would DEFINITELY have noticed that 
          before, there's no way I couldn't
            - Surely someone else will notice it?!
            - Can I convincingly pretend that I didn't touch it?
        - The inside of the shrine looked extremely old
            - There was something on the walls that has long long since rotted
              away (fibre weavings perhaps?)
                - If so maybe it was made by an ancient Caldera society?
    - Seems to eat matter
        - Anything in contact with it is very slowly absorbed
        - Some things are absorbed faster than others
            - Somehow related to place?
                - Sand and stones from the plateaus near Clearstone absorb
                  slightly faster...
                - I don't know what is different about their composition 
                  or anything
            - Haven't been able to find any other correlations
                - (But I haven't tested that much stuff to begin with)
        - Liquids are not absorbed faster than solids
            - I hadn't considered gasses yet but I think it might be eating the
              air as well (potentially bad)
        - The shrine was full of something
            - There was a giant empty glass tube on top of the tablet when I
              found it
            - The glass itself was eaten away a little bit but much less than
              I would expect
        - It hurts to hold since I think it's trying to eat my hands
            - Also, I don't remember it being warm to the touch but it kind 
              of is
            - (Probably should stop touching it) 
            - (Update: definitely stop touching it)
    - Composed of lots of "pages"
        - The tablet itself is actually lots of smaller tablets attached at
          alternating edges, it folds out like a long, many-jointed arm 
          or something
        - Each page is completely covered in symbols
            - They seem to have been carved directly in
                - Re-carved a lot, too
                - Lots of symbols (like, A LOT) are covered up or scratched out 
                  or similar
                - They're so small I can't really tell what they are yet - need
                  to look at this more
    - Thing in the bottommost page
        - The bottommost page is a little thicker than the rest and has a small
          compartment with something inside
            - Is this the thing that's actually doing the absorbing?
                - Seems kind of unlikely since the entire tablet, not just this
                  bottom part, has those properties
                - Maybe the rest of the tablet is permeable and everything just
                  flows into this bottom part
        - There's some kind of lock stopping me from getting in
            - There's four pieces that I think I have to rotate in just the 
              right way to unlock 
                - (no way I'm guessing the combination)
            - I think I could just smash it in with a chisel but I don't really
              want to do that
    - Who and what built it?
        - Was it an ancient Caldera people?
            - How did they do something like this?
            - I can't explain anything about how it works
        - Is it a CHEVRIN artifact?
            - Unlikely because of the symbols (or at least I hope)
                - They are physically carved in... but I still think they're
                  too small and precise to be done by them...
        - Is it maybe a Focus artifact?
            - Only KRAZA could have made it and it doesn't seem characteristic 
            for Him
                - Though, that might explain why it seems to "prefer" 
                  materials from places like Clearstone
            - If it's from our ancestors, did they have more powers from the 
              Focus than we realized?
            - What would compel the Focus to make this in the first place?
                - Are They finally asking for something in return?
                - Why me?
    - DZUNE is asking me about it
        - I don't know what to tell her
        - I don't want her to worry about it...
